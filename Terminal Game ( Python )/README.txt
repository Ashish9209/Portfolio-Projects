Build a terminal-based Tic-tac-toe game in Python. This project is a great way to showcase my programming skills.

This code implements a simple terminal-based Tic-tac-toe game in Python. It sets up a 3x3 game board, allows two players to take turns making moves, and checks for win or draw conditions after each move. The game continues until one player wins or the board is filled with no winner.
