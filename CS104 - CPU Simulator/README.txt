Python program that simulates the functionalities of a CPU involves several components. First, implement a simple CPU simulation with classes for the CPU, cache, and memory bus. Second, fetch instructions and initialization values from input files, and simulate how a CPU processes these instructions.

Project Overview :

-   Design Classes: Define classes for CPU, Cache, and Memory Bus.
-   Input Files: Read and parse instructions and initialization values from separate files.
-   Simulation: Implement the interaction between the CPU, cache, and memory bus.

Step for Implementation :
-   1. Create Python Classes
    -   CPU Class: Executes instructions and interacts with Cache and Memory Bus.
    -   Cache Class: Stores recently accessed data to speed up CPU operations.
    -   MemoryBus Class: Handles communication between the CPU and main memory.
-   2. Define the File Structure
    -   instructions.txt: Contains CPU instructions.
    -   memory_init.txt: Contains initial values for the Memory Bus.
    3. Implement the Program
