A database project for inventory management is a great way to showcase my skills with databases and PostgreSQL. This project will involve designing a schema, creating tables, inserting data, and running queries to manage and analyze inventory.

Hereâ€™s a steps taken to creating an inventory management database using PostgreSQL, including schema design, setup, and sample queries.

Project Overview :
-   Database Design: Define the schema, including tables for products, categories, suppliers, and inventory transactions.
