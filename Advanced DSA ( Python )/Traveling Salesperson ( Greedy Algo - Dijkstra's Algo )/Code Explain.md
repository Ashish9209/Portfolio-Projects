Code explanation

The selected code block is part of a program that solves the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). TSP is a classic computer science problem that involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of locations and returns to the starting location.

In this code block:

The visited_all_nodes function checks if all the vertices in the graph have been visited. It iterates over the visited vertices and returns False if any vertex is marked as “unvisited”. Otherwise, it returns True.
The traveling_salesperson function takes a graph as input and performs the TSP algorithm to find the shortest route. It uses a random starting vertex and a greedy approach to select the next vertex with the lowest edge weight. It updates the visited_vertices and the ts_path variables to keep track of the visited vertices and the current path. It continues this process until all vertices have been visited.
Finally, it prints the resulting TSP path.
So, when you run the code, it will generate a TSP path based on the provided graph.
