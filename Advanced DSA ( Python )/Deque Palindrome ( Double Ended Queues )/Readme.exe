Deques can be helpful when trying to determine if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string with the same characters when read forwards and backwards. The words level and kayak are examples of palindromes.

In our Implementing Deque in Python lesson, we covered the implementation of the deque data structure with our Deque class. In this project, we will use the Deque class to create a palindrome reader that will determine if any given string is a palindrome.
