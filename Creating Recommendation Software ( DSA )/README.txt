Build a simple recommendation program for movies. The program will allow users to enter a topic or keyword, suggest a movie category, and provide recommendations based on the category.

Project Overview :

Data Structure: use a dictionary to store movie categories and their related recommendations.
Algorithm: implement a simple search algorithm to match user input with available categories and provide relevant recommendations.

Steps Implement :

-   Create and Store Data: Use a dictionary to map categories to lists of movie recommendations.
-   User Input: Get user input and search for matching categories.
-   Display Recommendations: Show the recommendations based on the selected category.


This program demonstrates basic data handling and searching techniques in Python. Itâ€™s straightforward and can be expanded with more categories and advanced search algorithms as needed.
